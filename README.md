# finnish_derivations
Find morphological patterns between nouns and  verbs in the Finnish language via Kotus' XML corpus  (cf. kaino.kotus.fi/sanat/nykysuomi), log them in TXTs  and clean the original corpus from such derivations  leaving only nouns that cannot be derived into verbs,  and vice versa, i.e. sterile lexical units for further  analysis as for why they are morphologically unaccessible in an agglutinative language like Finnish.https://kaino.kotus.fi/sanat/nykysuomi/
